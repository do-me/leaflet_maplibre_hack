# Leaflet-Maplibre-Hack

This repo is only for you if you are bound to some legacy Leaflet version below v1.0 where vector tiles could not yet be displayed. 

The example here uses maplibre as base layer displaying protomaps basemaps. This layer is not supposed to be interactive, so it can stay in the background. The markers, lines and geometries are drawn on top of this basemap with Leaflet so you do not need to rewrite your application but can still use super performant and cheap protomaps-based basemaps, official OSM vector tiles or e.g. BKG basemaps for Germany with: style:`https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/gdz-basemapde-vektor-gdz-basemapde-vektor.html`
